# Vision
We want to create a game for individuals who suffer from anxiety. Tis game will be fun, relaxing and above all else cute!!!!! Games on the mobile app store are very stressful, competitive and costly. So instead we will create a plant growing based game inspired by Tamagotchi that will help our users pass the time without adding extra stress to their daily lives.

# Scope
## In
* Users will start with a basic plant and terrarium
* Users will be able to purchas new plants in the shop
* Users will be able to interact with their plants such as watering and pruning
* Users data will be persistent and will be in their own instance
* Users will be able to create an account/login with Facebbok, Google or Discord

## Out
* Will not sell in game items for real life currency
* Will never be pay to win
* User will always get a positive experience

# MVP
Users will be able to create an account manually or through OAuth via Facebbok, Google or Discord. Users will start with a base plant and base terrarium and will be able to start watering, pruning and earning in game currency with their plant. They will be able to progress by buying more plants and larger terrariums via the in game shop. The plant status will be updated automatically based on feeding times, when fed and the output of the plant will be based off of these as well. As the plant grows the image of the plant will change.

# Stretch
* Frontend Website for the app.
* Custom Items to the store that will decorate the plant
* Ads because we aren't doing this for free
* Add mini games

# Functional Requirements
* A User can create an account and login with their account
* A user can view their profile and update their information
* An Admin can create new plants and terrariums

# Non-Functional Requirements
* The user data will be secure utilizing a seperate backend api that will utilize bearer and tokens to access the information
* The software should be portable. So moving from one OS to other OS does not create any problem.
